    Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish that combines layers of rich flavors and comforting textures. Typically made with wide sheets of pasta, it’s layered with savory ingredients like ground meat (often beef or pork), marinara sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese, such as mozzarella and Parmesan. The dish is baked until bubbly and golden, with the flavors melding together into a deliciously satisfying meal. Lasagna is a versatile dish, with numerous variations, including vegetarian versions that swap meat for vegetables or ricotta-based fillings. It’s often served as a hearty dinner for gatherings, embodying warmth, tradition, and the simple joy of good food.

<li>Cook the meat: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat a little olive oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef (or beef/pork mixture) and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
<li>Cook the aromatics: Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the meat, and sauté for about 2-3 minutes until softened.</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes and seasoning: Stir in the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce (if using). Add basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. If using, pour in the red wine and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 2 cups shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, and the egg. Mix well.</li>
<li>Add chopped parsley (if using) and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions (usually about 8-10 minutes). Once cooked, drain and lay them flat on a baking sheet or paper towels to prevent sticking.</li>
