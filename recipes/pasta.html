<ul>
    <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Water</li>   
</ul>

<li>Make the Dough: On a clean surface, mound the flour and make a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well, add the olive oil and salt. Using a fork, whisk the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour. Once combined, knead the dough until smooth, about 8-10 minutes. Add water a little at a time if the dough feels too dry.

</li>
<li>Rest the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This helps to relax the gluten, making the dough easier to roll out.

</li>

<li>Roll the Dough: After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion out with a rolling pin or pasta machine until thin, about 1/8 inch thick.

</li>

<li>Cut the Pasta: Once the dough is rolled out, cut it into your desired pasta shape (e.g., fettuccine, pappardelle, or tagliatelle). Dust the cut pasta with flour to prevent sticking.

</li>

<li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta for 2-4 minutes (fresh pasta cooks faster than dried). Drain the pasta, toss with your favorite sauce, and serve immediately!
